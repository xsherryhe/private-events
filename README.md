This project is a website with similar functionality to [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/). It allows users to create, manage, and sign up for various events. It is built using Ruby on Rails

The project primarily demonstrates more advanced concepts related to Rails Active Record associations, including custom class names and foreign keys, "through" associations and sources, self joins, and creation/destruction of association objects.

This branch of the project attempts to use a custom-built time field in the "New Event" form rather than using Rails or HTML5 defaults.

This project is currently in progress.
