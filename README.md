This project is a website with similar functionality to [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/). It allows users to create, manage, and sign up for various events. It is built using Ruby on Rails.

The project primarily demonstrates more advanced concepts related to Rails Active Record associations, including custom class names and foreign keys, "through" associations and sources, self joins, and creation/destruction of association objects.
